My write-up material has been combined with my Shiny App but you can still read the html version (the names are "Introduction.html" and "Workflow.html").

The video has been uploaded to Youtube (link: https://youtu.be/wnCrCkR4Ma8) and you can also find it in the zip fold in case of internet or Youtube issue.

My raw data files are results.txt and vacounties.json.

Thanks a lot!
